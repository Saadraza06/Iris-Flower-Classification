# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
This project is a machine learning implementation for classifying iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” using the classic Iris dataset. It's often used as a beginner-level example in machine learning due to its simplicity and clean dataset.

# ðŸš€ Technologies Used
â€¢ Python 3.x

â€¢ Pandas

â€¢ NumPy

â€¢ Matplotlib / Seaborn

â€¢ Scikit-learn

# ðŸ“Š Insights

â€¢ Petal length & width are key features for classification.

â€¢ Setosa is easily separable; Versicolor & Virginica overlap slightly.

â€¢ Simple models like SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression give >95% accuracy.

â€¢ Petal features outperform sepal features in prediction.
