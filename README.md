# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
This project is a machine learning implementation for classifying iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using the classic Iris dataset. It's often used as a beginner-level example in machine learning due to its simplicity and clean dataset.

# 🚀 Technologies Used
• Python 3.x

• Pandas

• NumPy

• Matplotlib / Seaborn

• Scikit-learn

# 📊 Insights

• Petal length & width are key features for classification.

• Setosa is easily separable; Versicolor & Virginica overlap slightly.

• Simple models like SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression give >95% accuracy.

• Petal features outperform sepal features in prediction.
